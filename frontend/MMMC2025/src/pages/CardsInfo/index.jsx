          <h2>What is a Credit Card?</h2>
        </IconTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          A credit card allows you to borrow money from a financial institution to make purchases, with the agreement that youâ€™ll pay it back later â€” ideally on time. When used responsibly, credit cards are a powerful tool for building credit history, earning rewards, and managing short-term cash flow.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Unlike debit cards, credit cards donâ€™t draw from your bank balance. Instead, they work like a short-term loan. The key to using them wisely is to <strong>pay your full balance by the due date</strong> to avoid interest and fees.

          <h2>What are Credit Card Rewards?</h2>
        </IconTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          Credit card rewards are incentives that give you something back for every dollar you spend. There are typically three main types:
        </Paragraph>
        <List>
          <li><strong>Cash back:</strong> Earn a percentage of your spending back in money. Example: 2% back on groceries = $2 for every $100 spent.</li>
          <li><strong>Points:</strong> Earn points based on your spending that can be redeemed later for travel, shopping, or more.</li>
          <li><strong>Miles:</strong> A type of points typically used with travel credit cards. Great for flights, hotels, and vacation perks.</li>
        </List>
        <Paragraph>
          Some cards offer boosted rewards on specific categories like food, gas, or streaming. The more you align your spending with the cardâ€™s categories, the more you earn.
