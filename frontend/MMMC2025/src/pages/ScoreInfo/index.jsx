          <h2>What is a Credit Score?</h2>
        </IconTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          A credit score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness â€” how likely you are to repay borrowed money. The most common type is the FICOÂ® Score, which ranges from <strong>300 to 850</strong>. Lenders use it to determine how much you can borrow, your interest rate, and your repayment terms. In 2023, the average FICOÂ® Score in the U.S. was <strong>715</strong>.

          <h2>Does checking your score hurt it?</h2>
        </IconTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          No â€” <strong>checking your own credit score does NOT harm it</strong>. This is called a "soft inquiry" and has no impact on your score. In fact, monitoring your score regularly is a smart way to track your financial health and prevent identity theft.

          <li><strong>Payment History (35%)</strong> â€“ Always pay your bills on time. Even one late payment can hurt.</li>
          <li><strong>Amounts Owed (30%)</strong> â€“ Keep your credit usage below 30% of your limit.</li>
          <li><strong>Length of Credit History (15%)</strong> â€“ The older your accounts, the better.</li>
          <li><strong>Credit Mix (10%)</strong> â€“ A variety of credit types (cards, loans) is ideal.</li>
          <li><strong>New Credit (10%)</strong> â€“ Opening too many accounts at once can be risky.</li>
